Written for Windows 11, but could also work for POSIX systems given enough compiler retooling.

## Usage:
(Examples written for windows powershell)
Encoding text into an audio file:
```./steg.exe -e "message goes here"```
Decoding text from audio file:
```./steg.exe -d filename.wav```

More functionality to be added in the future.

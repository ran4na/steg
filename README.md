Written for Windows 11, but could also work for POSIX systems given enough compiler retooling.<br>

## Usage:
(Examples written for windows powershell)<br>
Encoding text into an audio file:<br>
``./steg.exe -e "message goes here"``<br>
Decoding text from audio file:<br>
``./steg.exe -d filename.wav``<br>

More functionality to be added in the future.
